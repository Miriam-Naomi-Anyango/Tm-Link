## Description
<p>Individuals in the IT field are more likely to take personal responsibility for their growth. With proper mentoring, they can be encouraged to pursue opportunities that benefit not only them but the industry itself. Technical Mentors can be especially helpful when the path to an IT career is not always linear.

Upon arrival of software engineering students at Moringa-school, quite a significant amount of time was taken for some students to know who their specific Technical Mentors were, hence delaying the time for the two parties getting to familiarize with each other as soon as possible and therefore getting necessary support.



TM Link is a web application that serves to help students who enroll for software engineering bootcamp at Moringa to know their Technical Mentors just before getting to meet them in person (Hybrid students) or virtually (Remote students), so that in case of any important information to be laid across or in the event that thereâ€™s a planning that should occur, all arrangements can be done with a lot of ease.

The students can also be aware of their Technical Mentors so that when they get to be physically introduced to them they can be easily linked to each other and therefore understand the requirements of operation.

The institution management can also use this data to relate students to their Technical Mentors for easy tracking and management.
